Hypothesis: To reduce the  cost of Honey associated with the production of mead and reduce the dependency on honey for materials, and encouraging the potential growth new industry in Florida agriculture a percentage of the honey with pollen from the SAME colony can be replaced keeping the alcohol content > 5.3% while and < 14% and most importantly maintaining the ingredient requirement given by the TTA protected definition of "Mead."

"The sugar content of pollen from the north Florida region may vary depending on the plant species and environmental conditions, but according to one study, it was about 421 grams per kilogram on average, which is equivalent to 42.1 percent. The sugar content of honey from the same region may also vary depending on the source of nectar and processing methods, but according to one source¹, it was about 17 grams per tablespoon (21 grams), which is equivalent to 80.9 percent. The main sugars in both pollen and honey are fructose and glucose¹ .
